## Why Papaya Season?

Many people know **how and when** it’s best to eat their local fruits.
But what about fruits that may **not grow local** to you - for example papayas? 
It would be a pity if people would end up to not liking the fruit, or might even throw it away. 
Papaya Season wants to help with this issue by providing the **harvest time** based on the country the papaya is from. 
This gives you the prerequisite to **enjoy** my favourite fruit as well.

## Data
For this app I've researched harvest times in several countries and tried to make the data as realistic as possible. But the data should still be considered as testdata.
